    <Paragraph>    
    I’m 22 and I’ve been developing games since I was 14. In 2018 I’ve co-founded a firm focused on contract work and I left that firm around the end of 2022. It was a very exciting experience but I didn’t like how much I had to focus on other things besides development.
    I’m very passionate about games and their history. I grew up playing legendary titles such as Age of Empires 2, Quake 3 and Need for Speed Underground 2. Through retro lets players on Youtube I was able to experience the majority of the old-school games to at least have a slight idea of what it was about and why it was innovative.
