    <Paragraph>    
    I’m 22 and I’ve been developing games since I was 14. In 2018 I’ve co-founded a firm focused on contract work and I left that firm around the end of 2022. It was a very exciting experience but I didn’t like how much I had to focus on other things besides development.
    I’m very passionate about games and their history. I grew up playing legendary titles such as Age of Empires 2, Quake 3 and Need for Speed Underground 2. Through retro lets players on Youtube I was able to experience the majority of the old-school games to at least have a slight idea of what it was about and why it was innovative.

# Commercial Projects

## iShowroom

![image info](assets/me.jpg)

In my company, I had the role of the architect and lead developer. I’ve defined the structure, developed many systems and I held the responsibility of the app's state towards the client.

The iShowroom project is an e-commerce platform which was always tailored to the specific needs of the end client. By utilizing 3D and AR/VR the goal was to create an immersive experience where the user would understand the product, fell in love with it and finally buy it.

## Leave No One Behind

![image info](assets/me.jpg)

Strategic game where you play as the US Army in the Vietnam War. The name “Leave No One Behind” is part of a quote which was said by one of the fabled general. 

> **Harold G. Moore**
*I can't promise you that I will bring you all home alive. But this I swear, before you and before Almighty God, that when we go into battle, I will be the first to set foot on the field, and I will be the last to step off, and I will leave no one behind. Dead or alive, we will all come home together. So help me, God." ~ Lt Gen Hal Moore, (Ret) 'We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young: Ia Drang-The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam*
> 

The game honors that quote by having one of the main mechanics being that the player has to collect all fallen soldiers and get them home.
